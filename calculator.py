addition = float(n1) + float(n2) # makes a variable called addition that holds the value of the sum of the variables n1 and n2 both in float format.

# This is an example of the output which is also commented
# Enter a first number: #for example 3 which you can type
# Enter another number: #for example 6 which you can type as well
# then it will print: the bit from above with the free line seperating it from the  input code but only the stuff inside the print with double quotes and then the variable for example
# the modulo wich will then be printed under the division and like that in the order it is writen in code so

# addition 
# multiplication
# subtraction
# division
# modulo
# divisionRoundedWithoutDecimals
