# Programming-projects-with-explanations

Hi all! I made this repository in the hope that others you want to start programming can have some source code to copy and understand the basics before they dive deep. <br>
There will be comments after each line explaining what part that line plays in the final result.
There will Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a .sh file which you can use to install python and the needed modules etc.
